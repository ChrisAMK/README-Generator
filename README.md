# Read-Me Generator&middot; ![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Academic%20Free%20License%20v3.0-blue) ![Maker's Mark](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/ChrisAMK/README-Generator?style=plastic)

## Description 
For this project we were tasked with Creating a README generator, it's primary function is to take in input from the user and display that information back in a professional manner that resembles a proper README file that you would see in someone's repository. The key skills needed where NODE.JS and learning the language and behaviour of writing in MD markup files. we had to install node packages using npm to gain the functionality of a new kind of prompt since node.js does not support your typical javascript prompt function. the trickiest part was writing the code to find the License badge depending of which license you choose from the list but it's all good practice writing functions and passing parameters around.
